            <h2>Information About Flowers</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 1973 sunflowers appeared in my father's vegetable garden. They seemed to sprout overnight in a few rows
            he had lent that year to new neighbors from California. Only six years old at the time, I was at first put off by these
            garish plants. Such strange and vibrant flowers seemed out of place among the respectable beans, peppers, spinach, and
            other vegetables we had always grown. Gradually, however, the brilliance of the sunflowers won me over. Their fiery
            halos relieved the green monotone that by late summer ruled the garden. I marveled at birds that clung upside down to
            the shaggy, gold disks, wings fluttering, looting the seeds. Sunflowers defined flowers for me that summer and changed
            my view of the world.</p>
